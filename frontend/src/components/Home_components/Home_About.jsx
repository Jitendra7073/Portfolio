        <p>
          <span className="hey_emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> Iâ€™m a B.Tech CSE (AI & ML)
          student in my 3rd year, 6th semester, passionate about building smart
          solutions and making technology work like magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I play around with AI, machine learning, and full-stack development,
          coding in Python, C, C++, Java, and moreâ€”basically speaking multiple
          languages, just none that humans use. I also love data analysis,
          turning raw numbers into cool insights (because numbers do tell
          stories!).
        </p>
        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not busy debugging my life (or my code), youâ€™ll find me
          gaming, traveling, or managing events like a pro. I believe in
          learning, creating, and pushing boundariesâ€”so letâ€™s connect and build
          something amazing...!
