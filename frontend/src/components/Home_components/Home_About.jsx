          <span className="hey_emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> I'm a final-year B.Tech (CSE)
          student at Uka Tarsadia University. Iâ€™m passionate about building
          smart solutions and making technology work like magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I explore AI, machine learning, and full-stack developmentâ€”coding in
          Python, C++, and more. You could say I speak multiple languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not debugging my life (or my code), youâ€™ll probably find me
          gaming, traveling, or managing events. I believe in learning,
          creating, and pushing boundariesâ€”so letâ€™s connect and build something
          amazing!
